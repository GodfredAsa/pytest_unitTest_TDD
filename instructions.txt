Pytest is a python unit testing framework
- ability to create tests, test modules, and test fixtures
- has commandline parameters to help filter which tests are executed and in what order
- Similar tests can be grouped in the same module or class

Test Discovery
- automatically discover tests when executed based on certain naming standards
- test function names should begin with test Eg def test_example
- classes with tests in them should name their names start with "Test" and should not have the __init__ method
- NB: Filenames of test modules should start or end with test Eg test_example.py or example_test.py

console command: pytest -v

Setup and Tear down
-- helps reduce code duplication
these test methods execute before
- Test modules
- test functions
- test classes
- test methods in the test classes
